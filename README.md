# ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Blog Creator

An interactive **Streamlit + CrewAI** application that demonstrates how multiple AI agents â€” a **Planner**, **Writer**, and **Editor** â€” collaborate in real time to produce a high-quality blog post on any given topic.

This project provides a hands-on demo of **multi-agent collaboration**, showing live logs for each step of the content creation pipeline directly in the browser.
